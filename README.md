## SpikingNeuralNet STDP based GasClassification

- This is a place for comments and code for  
for our paper *A Spiking Neural Network for Time-Efficient Gas Concentration Level
Estimation in Resistor-Type Gas Sensors* 
- Code will be uploaded later after refineing the current code.

***********************************************************
## Datasets 
- Transient gas responses obtained from a metal-oxide-based resistor-type gas
sensor, where the sensor was fabricated in our lab.

***************************************************************
## Main Features
- Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) 
based 
- Gas responses are time-series data. We
generate a 2-dimensional data (ie, image) from
a time series sample(ie, a sequence of reponse measurements).
So, we can utlize a large number of machine learning code and techniqeus
that has already be carried out for our research.
